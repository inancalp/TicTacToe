# TicTacToe
Here's my very first project where I put my newly learned fundamentals into action. It was a good start for me to see what I've picked up, without online assistance.


# What I Learned
- Variables and Data Types
- Lists and Sets
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- String Manipulation
- Etc.


# How to Run
- Install python and add it to the path if you haven't.
- With using a CLI tool, navigate to the directory where "tictactoe.py" is included within the project.
- Then execute the command "python tictactoe.py" to run the game.
